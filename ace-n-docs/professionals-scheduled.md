# ðŸ‘©âš• Professionals (Scheduled late 2023)

We, and other specialist Assistive Technology services would benefit from collaborating on real world problems and helping the industry as a whole to prioritise these challenges. Where possible also create exemplar solutions.  We envision a broad group of individuals may wish to be involved in such discussion and iterative product development. This includes&#x20;

* NHS Specialised Services
* SIG/other networks
* Local Area AAC Centres (LAACES)
* Partnerships with Ace Centre
* Other education, health and social care staff providing local services

We would not intend on having a payment system to these individuals however we would be clear in a memorandum of understanding (yet to be created) that:

* Any Minimal Viable product/Exemplar applications/products that would be created would be under a Open - share-alike or similar - [licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)&#x20;
* We aim to make solutions free to those who require it. However we are aware some products may require continual development or use third party systems which incur costs. Upfront we will discuss any costs with those involved in the network
* We ask for all services involved in this group to seriously consider donating to the Ace Centre if this network is benefical to them or their users.&#x20;
