### 1. As a user group member of ATUN, you are entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

#### What expenses can you claim for?

1. Your travel: If you travel by train, bus or tram we will reimburse the cost of your return travel. If you think you will need a taxi, you will need to agree this with us first. If you travel by car, we can pay 45p per mile of your journey.
2. Overnight accommodation if appropriate: This would need to be agreed in advance, and the booking would probably be done by Ace Centre. We would need to consider eligibility criteria - probably along the lines of our existing policy for staff.
3. Refreshments: This would need to be agreed in advance, and we would need to consider eligibility criteria - probably along the lines of our existing policy for staff. NB Typically, refreshments could/would be provided at meetings by Ace Centre.
4. Carers or Support Workers: We can pay expenses for anyone who needs to come with you, but you need to agree this with us first.
5. Office Supplies: If you are part of a meeting at home, we can give you Â£5. This is to help pay for telephone calls, internet connection, paper and printing ink.

#### How do you get your expenses?

Keep all of your receipts to show us what money you have spent and tell us how much we should give you.

Fill in an expenses claim form and send it back to us with the receipts of what you have bought. You should submit your claim form within 3 months of the event or activity you went to.

If we have any questions about your claim form we will contact you. If we are happy with your claim form we will pay you via your preferred payment method (cheque, bank transfer). You should receive your money within 2 weeks of submitting your claim form.

### 2. Your time, knowledge and skills are important and should be valued. This should be funded for when at all possible

We value your experience and knowledge and would like to assess the feasibility of paying you for your participation where appropriate, whilst recognising that some participants may opt not to receive such payment.

We are using this[ guidance from the NIHR ](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/Payment-for-Public-Involvement-in-Health-and-Care-Research-A-guide-for-organisations-on-determining-the-most-appropriate-payment-approach/30838)for direction on how we fund indviduals for this work. Public contributors involved in health and care research are, in most cases, not considered to be [employees](https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/employee) or casual [workers](https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/worker). But the assessment of whether public contributors are employees must be done for each involvement activity and/or role. See [here](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/Payment-for-Public-Involvement-in-Health-and-Care-Research-A-guide-for-organisations-on-determining-the-most-appropriate-payment-approach/30838#Annex%203%20-%20decision%20flowchart) for a flowchart on this desiscion process. Note there are two example areas which may denote being a employee.

"**Activity example five: ongoing involvement in a research project or in organisational governance, providing independent advice over a period of time. Likely to include preparation and remote work between meetings**\
\
**"Activity example six: being a full and equal member of the research project/ organisation team, potentially carrying out research"**

In these types of instances Ace centre will have to discuss with you about your role, terms and employment details. Rate and terms will be discussed on a case by case basis.

For other non employment based work we aim to detail openly the process on defining costs to both third parties and end users. End users may wish to reduce or pass on payments to the charity (Ace Centre). These forms of payment may be all valid:

* Payment to a bank account
* Cash
* Vouchers
* Gifts
* Access to training opportunities

#### How much will I get paid?

We aim to follow national gudiance where possible. As a bare minimum [National Minimum Wages ](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates)will be followed. As our involvement with the User group and third parties develops we will document here working examples.

#### **What activities could be paid for activities?**

* Face to face time where you share your experiences and knowledge. This will be outlined ahead of any meeting or project.

#### **What activities could not be paid for?**

* Time for correspondence (emails and letters).
* Time to travel to events.
* New equipment for you to keep (any trials of equipment will be on a loan-only basis).
