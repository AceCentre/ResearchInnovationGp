# Memorandum of Understanding

This Memorandum of Understanding sets out the areas of shared interest among the Members of the Stakeholder Groups and the Staff of the Ace Centre. It sets out the principles we wish to operate by in our joint working.

This non-binding agreement reflects our commitment to collaborate, formally and informally, to deliver shared objectives, being mindful of Ace Centre's strategic objectives for public involvement in research and development.

### Objectives

The objects of the ACE Network are:

1. To advance the development of AAC and eAT services and products.
2. To provide users with a supportive and welcoming environment that enables rich and valuable discourse.
3. To act as a consultative network for research and development priorities both for Ace Centre's work and, subject to individual participant's consent, for the work of other organisations.

### Shared Principles

1. We recognise that meaningful partnership with the communities we serve is the best way of delivering research that is relevant and of maximum benefit to users and their supporters.
2. We will promote opportunities for, and widen involvement in, collaborative research and development.
3. We will recognise and reward the contribution of users and members of the public who we involve in our work.
4. We are committed to the most effective use of resources and will seek opportunities to collaborate where appropriate, rather than duplicate effort.
5. We are committed to sharing best practice and learning.
