# ðŸ™‚ Users

There are many terms used for this stakeholder group: People Who use AAC (PWUAAC), Individuals, Clients, Patients.  Ace Centre consider that anyone who is the end user of AAC or Assistive Technology (whether electronic or paper based) is a member of this stakeholder group.

Individuals who use AAC or AT to communicate in their daily lives have a great wealth of knowledge and insight to share to improve the products and resources that they use and the support and services that they receive.

Ace Centre recognise the value of lived experience that users of AAC  & AT have, and their important role as expert contributors across a range of activities, including, but not limited to, taking part in meetings & events and contributing experience & expertise to research, evidence-gathering and policy development.

Users of AAC  & AT have a vital contribution to make in terms of identifying issues with existing services and other resources and in developing and testing effective improvements and solutions.&#x20;

We firmly believe in putting users at the heart of our processes.&#x20;

We aim to establish a "Users" group that benefits both the participating users themselves and the AT community as a whole.&#x20;

Ace Centre will:

* Develop a range of opportunities/mechanisms for participation to optimise accessibility and engagement.
* Regularly feedback to the group on how their input has been used.
* Ensure participants are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
* Consider a variety of options for a range of paid for participation.
* Provide social opportunities for participants.
* Peer discussion and support?
