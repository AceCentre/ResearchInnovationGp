# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ‘¨ðŸ‘§ Supporters (Scheduled 2023)

Ace Centre anticipate that this stakeholder group will include:

* Family members
* Friends
* Care-givers, both paid and unpaid

In short, Ace Centre consider that anyone who provides support to the end user of AAC or AT (whether electronic or paper based) is a member of this stakeholder group.

Ace Centre recognise the value of lived experience that people who support users of AAC & eAT have, and their important role as expert contributors across a range of activities, including, but not limited to, taking part in meetings & events and contributing experience & expertise to research, evidence-gathering and policy development.

Those that support users of AAC & eAT have a vital contribution to make in terms of identifying issues with existing services and other resources and in developing and testing effective improvements and solutions.&#x20;

We recognise the importance of engaging supporters in our planned ACE-N.&#x20;

We aim to establish a "Supporters" group that benefits both the participating users themselves and the AT community as a whole.&#x20;

Ace Centre will:

* Develop a range of opportunities/mechanisms for participation to optimise accessibility and engagement.
* Regularly feedback to the group on how their input has been used.
* Ensure participants are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
* Consider a variety of options for a range of paid for participation?
* Provide social opportunities for participants?
