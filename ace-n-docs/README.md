# Overview of Ace Centre Experts Network (ACE-N)

Ace Centre's vision is a society where everyone is given the support they need to communicate, be understood and fulfil their potential. We believe that this vision can only be achieved by open and collaborative working.

One of the ways in which we aim to achieve this goal is by providing a forum for different key stakeholder groups to contribute to the planning, development, trial and evaluation of products, resources and/or services for the Augmentative & Alternative Communication (AAC) and electronic Assistive Technology (eAT) field.

Ultimately, we plan to recruit to the _Ace Centre Experts Network (ACE-N)_ - _working title_ - from three main groups:

* **Users** - people who use AAC and electronic Assistive Technology (eAT)
* **Supporters** - including family members and caregivers
* **Professionals** - education, health and social care professionals working to provide local, regional and national AAC and eAT services and support

As a first step, we want to establish a stakeholder group of people who use AAC/eAT (which we shall shorten to "**Users**" for this document)_._
