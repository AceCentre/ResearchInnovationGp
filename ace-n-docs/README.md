# ðŸŽ‰ Introduction to the Assistive Tech User's Network (ATUN)

Ace Centre's vision is a society where everyone is given the support they need to communicate, be understood and fulfil their potential. We believe that this vision can only be achieved by open and collaborative working.

How we aim to achieve this goal by&#x20;

* Open Development. We work with organisations (Academic, Business or Non-Profit) who share our goal and wish to collaborate on innovation in the field.  This may be in service delivery or products.  We may support this by providing services such as clinical trial support or insights into learnings from our work. Equally, there may be times when the Charity supports teams directly with its financial contributions.&#x20;
* Putting Users at the heart of innovation. Providing a space for different key stakeholder groups to contribute to the planning, development, trial and evaluation of products, resources and/or services, i.e. all stages of development. Having an authentic voice to drive the development of the sector
* Valuing knowledge.  We feel it is imperative that we actively value end users of AT. This is a two-way process. To fully value members means giving them meaningful and purposeful roles within the network. We will support members to help develop and improve the network and ongoing outcomes
* Providing a forum for end users and professionals in the sector to meet and share experiences. We value the need for both face-to-face and distance communication.&#x20;

To meet these aims, we feel that a new members network to help facilitate the development of the field is essential. Ace Centre is well suited to do this, being a charity and where we can fund the administration of such a group where other organisations may struggle to do this for the long term.  We want to facilitate the members to shape the organisation. Ultimately, we plan to recruit to the _Ace Centre Experts Network (ACE-N)_ - from three main groups:

* **Users** - people who use AAC and electronic Assistive Technology (eAT)
* **Supporters** - including family members and caregivers
* **Professionals** - education, health and social care professionals working to provide local, regional and national AAC and eAT services and support

As a first step, we want to establish a stakeholder group of people who use AAC/eAT (which we shall shorten to "**Users**" for this document)_._ \
\
_"Members"_ or _"Experts"_ is the term we use to denote ANY group member.
