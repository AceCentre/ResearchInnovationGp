# Supporting all needs

We are committed to creating a diverse and supportive network that caters to the needs and abilities of all individuals. We want to ensure that everyone, regardless of their challenges or circumstances, has a voice and can participate fully in the network.

**Our Current Platform:**

We currently operate an online forum designed with accessibility at its core. Members can engage with the forum directly on the web or participate entirely via email, ensuring that even those without continuous internet access can stay connected.

**Our Commitment to Do More:**

We recognise that our members come from varied backgrounds and face different challenges. To enhance our support, we are focusing on the following groups:

1. **Individuals with Learning Disabilities or Literacy Difficulties**
2. **Technologically Isolated Individuals**
3. **Non-native Language Speakers**
4. **Individuals with Disabilities Affecting Site Use:**

**Our Initiatives:**

To meet these needs, we are implementing several initiatives:

* **Regular Newsletter in Easy-to-Read Format:** We will distribute a newsletter designed to be accessible and straightforward, ensuring all members are informed and engaged.
* **Advocacy and Specialist Communication Tools:** Understanding that some members may need additional support to communicate, we will provide access to advocacy services and specialist communication tools to facilitate their participation.
* **Translation and Multilingual supports.** Translating key documents and providing interpreters at face-to-face meetings
* **Remove barriers within our site** to make it more accessible to individuals with various disabilities.

**Your Role and Feedback:**

Your experience and feedback are vital to our mission. We encourage all members to share their thoughts and suggestions on how we can further enhance the accessibility and inclusiveness of our community.

Together, we can build a network representing and supporting every member.&#x20;
