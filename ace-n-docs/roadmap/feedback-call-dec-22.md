"Hi All!

Long story short, I have to scrap the call I planned today. So sorry if you have tried to join or changed your plans around me!\
\
This is it in brief:

* Email is voted as the best way to stay connected
* People are happy with the name as it is – with one person saying we should not use the Ace centre name.&#x20;
* Created a roadmap. You can see this – and any other tweaks to our planning here: [Roadmap - Assitive Tech User's Network(ATUN)](https://docs.acecentre.org.uk/ace-centre-experts-ace/S4kJQl5iZwvp4ckVj0MO/roadmap) – let us know your thoughts. We aim to speak to you all separately in the new year to get you more formally involved. Right now, there are 15 of you I’m B’ccing into this email - So, apologies if this is spam for you right now but come the new year, I’ll migrate this to an email discussion forum of some kind and seek your permission/interest.&#x20;

&#x20;

Feedback if you have it: [https://forms.office.com/r/nFz7LhyXWW](https://forms.office.com/r/nFz7LhyXWW) - or just drop me an email! Or – if you wish to chat to me use this: [https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/WIllWade@acecentre.org.uk/bookings/](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/WIllWade@acecentre.org.uk/bookings/) (it will use Teams, but if you wish it to be Zoom, that’s good with me!)\
\
Sorry again!&#x20;

And.. Happy Christmas!\
\
Will"
