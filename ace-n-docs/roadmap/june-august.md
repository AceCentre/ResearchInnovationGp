# June-August

Two dates were offered but neither could be agreed on by volunteer chairs

As such we need to set a new date

Discussion following meetings with end users at ISAAC has led WW to consider these steps:

* Be more focused on AAC
* Setting up the web platform from day 1&#x20;
* Allowing option for no call needed to sign people up - but improving the sign up form.&#x20;
* Making sign up form multilingual
* Duplicating our trello system (form and trello board) and openly allowing people to rate on entries. DO this from day 1 but welcome people to bear in mind its in testing phase
* Set up a calendar of events ahead of launch . Face to face meetings, reviewing items, seeking progress on these items etc
