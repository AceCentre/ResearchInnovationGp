# ℹ️ Data collection & management

As an ATUN participant, you will be asked to complete an Enrolment Form. The data you provide will be collected, stored and managed following Ace Centre's [Privacy Policy](https://acecentre.org.uk/page/privacy).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to join the group, an Ace Centre staff member will contact you and help you review this form. Please feel free[ or drop us an email if this is the case](https://acecentre.org.uk/contact).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You may wish to participate in various activities, e.g., joining the email forum and meeting others, or only a small number, e.g., research studies that may fund you directly. **It's up to you how much you get involved**
{% endhint %}

In short:

* Ace Centre will collect the minimum data we need to operate ATUN effectively.
* We will store this information securely and only retain it for as long as is necessary to meet the purposes of ATUN (or to meet statutory requirements where these are more onerous).
* We will only share your data with third parties if we have your prior, explicit consent (or where we are required to do so by law).
* Under data protection legislation, you have several rights to your personal information. For more information about these rights, see our [Privacy Policy](https://acecentre.org.uk/page/privacy). To exercise any of these rights, please get in touch with [dpo@acecentre.org.uk](mailto:dpo@acecentre.org.uk)
* If you wish to drop out of this group please email wwade@acecentre.org.uk and we will remove your data from the group immediately&#x20;

To explain in more detail, we have a couple of examples

1. **A researcher (Ace Centre, NHS service, Academic partner, etc) wishes to carry out a questionnaire on a topic to gain your views. Or A company wish to gain your feedback on a new feature or total product.**

* If you have agreed to be involved with external research and development (Q6 of the Consent form), a member of the administration team will see who in the network meets the criteria set out by the researcher. The administration team may need to contact you for further information to see if you meet any specific criteria.
* The administration team will contact you with a Participant information leaflet to see if you are interested. If you are interested, I will be sure to answer this question. We will only reach out to you if you wish to be contacted. _NB: We may do this initial enquiry via phone, email or letter, depending on how you have requested to find out_
* You will then be sent a more specific consent form to agree to the study. We'll keep this brief and separate from consent already provided to be part of the network. **Note - depending on the study design, specific information about you may be required to be shared with the principal investigator. But this will be minimal and only with your explicit consent.**
* Only the minimal details will be passed on to the team. This will have been identified in the initial research plan.

2. **Ace Centre itself want to ask your opinion on a local service delivery improvement plan**

* We will openly invite (email, Forum, direct if consented) to join a focus group to discuss an improvement plan (in the planning stage or at the end of the process)
* You won't have to join. We may ask up to two times, but you won't be forced.&#x20;
