# â„¹ Data collection & management

As an ATUN participant, you will be asked to complete an Enrolment Form. The data you provide will be collected, stored and managed following Ace Centre's [Privacy Policy](https://acecentre.org.uk/page/privacy). to ring

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are interested in joining the group, an Ace Centre staff member will contact you and help you review this form. Please feel free[ or drop us an email if this is the case](https://acecentre.org.uk/contact).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You may wish to get involved with a range of activities, e.g., joining the email forum and meeting others, or only a small number, e.g., research studies that may fund you directly. **It's up to you how much you get involved**
{% endhint %}

In short:

* Ace Centre will collect the minimum amount of data we need to operate ATUN effectively.
* We will store this information securely and only retain it for as long as is necessary to meet the purposes of ATUN (or to meet statutory requirements where these are more onerous).
* We will not share your data with any third parties unless we have your prior, explicit consent to do so (or where we are required to do so by law).
* Under data protection legislation, you have several rights in relation to your personal information. For more information about these rights, see our [Privacy Policy](https://acecentre.org.uk/page/privacy). To exercise any of these rights, please get in touch with [dpo@acecentre.org.uk](mailto:dpo@acecentre.org.uk)

To explain in more detail, we have a couple of examples

1. **A researcher (Ace Centre, NHS service, Academic partner, etc) wishes to carry out a questionnaire on a topic to gain your views. Or A company wish to gain your feedback on a new feature or total product.**

* If you have agreed to be involved with external research and development (Q6 of the Consent form) a member of the administration team will see who in the network meets the criteria set out by the researcher. The administration team may need to contact you to ask further information to see if you meet any specific criteria.
* The administration team will reach out to you with a Participant information leaflet to see if you are interested. If you are interested, I will be sure to follow this question. We will only further contact you if you wish to be contacted. _NB: We may do this inital enquiry via phone, email or letter, depending on how you have requested to find out_
* You will then be sent a more specific consent form to agree to the study. We will keep this brief and ideally separate from consent already provided to be part of the network. **Note - depending on the study design, specific information about you may be required to be shared with the principal investigator. But this will be minimal and only with your explicit consent.**
* Only the minimal details will be passed on to the team. This will have been identified in the initial research plan.

2. **Ace Centre itself want to ask your opinion on a local service delivery improvement plan**

* We will openly invite (email, Forum, direct if consented) to join a focus group to discuss an improvement plan (in the planning stage or at the end of the process)
* You will not be obliged to join. We may ask up to two times, but you won't be forced.&#x20;
